This blog post summarize important aspects of designing effective prompts to maximize LLM performance. ### Key Considerations for Prompt Design **Specificity and Clarity:** Just like giving instructions to a human, prompts should clearly articulate the desired outcome. Ambiguity can lead to unexpected or irrelevant outputs. **Structured Inputs and Outputs:** Structuring inputs using formats like JSON or XML can significantly enhance an LLM\\'s ability to understand and process information. Similarly, specifying the desired output format (e.g., a list, paragraph, or code snippet) improves response relevance. **Delimiters for Enhanced Structure:** Utilizing special characters as delimiters within prompts can further clarify the structure and segregate different elements, improving the model\\'s understanding. **Task Decomposition for Complex Operations:** Instead of presenting LLMs with a monolithic prompt encompassing multiple tasks, breaking down complex processes into simpler subtasks significantly improves clarity and performance. This allows the model to focus on each subtask individually, ultimately leading to a more accurate overall outcome. ### Advanced Prompting Strategies **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the LLM with a few examples of desired input-output pairs guides it towards generating higher-quality responses by demonstrating the expected pattern. Learn more about few-shot prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot). **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encouraging the model to \"think step-by-step\" by explicitly prompting it to break down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps enhances its ability to solve problems that require logical deduction. Learn more about chain-of-thought prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot). **ReAct (Reason + Act):** This method focuses on eliciting advanced reasoning, planning, and even tool use from the LLM. By structuring prompts to encourage these capabilities, developers can unlock more sophisticated and powerful applications. Learn more about ReAct [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react). ### Conclusion Effective prompt design is crucial for harnessing the full potential of LLMs. By adhering to best practices like specificity, structured formatting, task decomposition, and leveraging advanced techniques like few-shot, chain-of-thought, and ReAct prompting, developers can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and complexity of outputs generated by these powerful LLMs. ### Want to Learn More? import { Callout } from \\'nextra/components\\' <Callout type= \"info\" emoji=\"🎉\"> We are excited to launch our brand new course website and releasing our first course on [Introduction to Prompt Engineering](https://dair-ai.thinkific.com/courses/introduction-prompt-engineering).

This blog post summarize important aspects of designing effective prompts to maximize LLM performance. ### Key Considerations for Prompt Design **Specificity and Clarity:** Just like giving instructions to a human, prompts should clearly articulate the desired outcome. Ambiguity can lead to unexpected or irrelevant outputs. **Structured Inputs and Outputs:** Structuring inputs using formats like JSON or XML can significantly enhance an LLM\\'s ability to understand and process information. Similarly, specifying the desired output format (e.g., a list, paragraph, or code snippet) improves response relevance. **Delimiters for Enhanced Structure:** Utilizing special characters as delimiters within prompts can further clarify the structure and segregate different elements, improving the model\\'s understanding. **Task Decomposition for Complex Operations:** Instead of presenting LLMs with a monolithic prompt encompassing multiple tasks, breaking down complex processes into simpler subtasks significantly improves clarity and performance. This allows the model to focus on each subtask individually, ultimately leading to a more accurate overall outcome. ### Advanced Prompting Strategies **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the LLM with a few examples of desired input-output pairs guides it towards generating higher-quality responses by demonstrating the expected pattern. Learn more about few-shot prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot). **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encouraging the model to \"think step-by-step\" by explicitly prompting it to break down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps enhances its ability to solve problems that require logical deduction. Learn more about chain-of-thought prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot). **ReAct (Reason + Act):** This method focuses on eliciting advanced reasoning, planning, and even tool use from the LLM. By structuring prompts to encourage these capabilities, developers can unlock more sophisticated and powerful applications. Learn more about ReAct [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react). ### Conclusion Effective prompt design is crucial for harnessing the full potential of LLMs. By adhering to best practices like specificity, structured formatting, task decomposition, and leveraging advanced techniques like few-shot, chain-of-thought, and ReAct prompting, developers can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and complexity of outputs generated by these powerful LLMs. ### Want to Learn More? import { Callout } from \\'nextra/components\\' <Callout type= \"info\" emoji=\"🎉\"> We are excited to launch our brand new course website and releasing our first course on [Introduction to Prompt Engineering](https://dair-ai.thinkific.com/courses/introduction-prompt-engineering).

       "   \"solution involves the potential to realign the LLM by designing advanced prompting strategies. - **Prompt robustness and reliability**: an LLM agent can involve several prompts designed to power the different modules like memory and planning. It's common to encounter reliability issues in LLMs with even the slightest changes to prompts. LLM agents involve an entire prompt framework which makes it more prone to robustness issues. The potential solutions include crafting prompt elements through trial and error, automatically optimizing/tuning prompts, or automatically generating prompts using GPT. Another common issue with LLMs is hallucination which is also prevalent with LLM agents. These agents rely on natural language to interface with external components that could be introducing conflicting information leading to hallucination and factuality issues. - **Knowledge boundary**: similar to knowledge mismatch issues that could lead to hallucination or factuality issues, it's challenging to control the knowledge scope of LLMs which can significantly impact the effectiveness of simulations. Concretely, an LLM's internal knowledge could introduce biases or utilize user-unknown knowledge that could affect the agent's behavior when operating in specific environments. - **Efficiency**: LLM agents involve a significant amount of requests that are handled by the LLM which could affect the efficiency of agent actions because it would depend heavily on the LLM inference speed. Cost is also a concern when deploying multiple agents. ## References - [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) - [MRKL Systems: A modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language models, external knowledge sources and discrete reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) - [A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432) - [The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864) - [Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01680) - [Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427) - [Introduction to LLM Agents](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/) - [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/tool_use/agents) - [Building Your First LLM Agent Application](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-your-first-llm-agent-application/) - [Building LLM applications for production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html#control_flow_with_llm_agents) - [Awesome LLM agents](https://github.com/kaushikb11/awesome-llm-agents) - [Awesome LLM-Powered Agent](https://github.com/hyp1231/awesome-llm-powered-agent#awesome-llm-powered-agent) - [Functions, Tools and Agents with LangChain](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/functions-tools-agents-langchain/)\",\n",

Using effective prompt strategies can steer the model to produce better, more consistent, and more factual responses. LLMs can also be especially useful for generating data which is useful to run all sorts of experiments. For example, we can use it to generate quick samples for a sentiment classifier like so: *Prompt:* ``` Produce 10 exemplars for sentiment analysis. Examples are categorized as either positive or negative. Produce 2 negative examples and 8 positive examples. Use this format for the examples: Q: <sentence> A: <sentiment> ``` *Output:* ``` Q: I just got the best news ever! A: Positive Q: We just got a raise at work! A: Positive Q: I\\'m so proud of what I accomplished today. A: Positive Q: I\\'m having the best day ever! A: Positive Q: I\\'m really looking forward to the weekend. A: Positive Q: I just got the best present ever! A: Positive Q: I\\'m so happy right now. A: Positive Q: I\\'m so blessed to have such an amazing family. A: Positive Q: The weather outside is so gloomy. A: Negative Q: I just got some terrible news. A: Negative ``` This is very useful. We use this example for a different test in another section of the guides. Here is another prompt example showing how to leverage the LLM for data labeling/augmentation task. *Prompt:* ``` produce 3 wine reviews and label taste, flavor, aroma related token; present the result as a json file, in addition add the coordinate of each term for NER task ``` *Output:* ``` [ { \"review\": \"This Chardonnay has a rich, creamy texture with notes of vanilla and buttery oak.

This guide covers the basics of standard prompts to provide a rough idea of how to use prompts to interact and instruct large language models (LLMs). All examples are tested with `text-davinci-003` (using OpenAI\\'s playground) unless otherwise specified. It uses the default configurations, e.g., `temperature=0.7` and `top-p=1`. Topic: - [Basic Prompts](#basic-prompts) - [A Word on LLM Settings](#a-word-on-llm-settings) - [Standard Prompts](#standard-prompts) - [Prompt Elements](#elements-of-a-prompt) - [General Tips for Designing Prompts](#general-tips-for-designing-prompts) --- ## Basic Prompts You can already achieve a lot with prompts, but the quality of results depends on how much information you provide it. A prompt can contain information like the `instruction` or `question` you are passing to the model and include other details such as `inputs` or `examples`. Here is a basic example of a simple prompt: *Prompt* ``` The sky is ``` *Output:* ``` blue The sky is blue on a clear day. On a cloudy day, the sky may be gray or white. ``` As you can see, the language model outputs a continuation of strings that make sense given the context `\"The sky is\"`. The output might be unexpected or far from the task we want to accomplish. This basic example also highlights the necessity to provide more context or instructions on what specifically we want to achieve. Let\\'s try to improve it a bit: *Prompt:* ``` Complete the sentence: The sky is ``` *Output:* ``` so beautiful today. ``` Is that better? Well, we told the model to complete the sentence so the result looks a lot better as it follows exactly what we told it to do (\"complete the sentence\"). This approach of designing optimal prompts to instruct the model to perform a task is what\\'s referred to as **prompt engineering**. The example above is a basic illustration of what\\'s possible with LLMs today. Today\\'s LLMs can perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation. --- ## A Word on LLM Settings When working with prompts, you will be interacting with the LLM via an API or directly. You can configure a few parameters to get different results for your prompts. **Temperature** - In short, the lower the temperature the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing the temperature could lead to more randomness encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. We are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens.

       "   'above is a basic illustration of what\\'s possible with LLMs today. Today\\'s LLMs are able to perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation. ## Prompt Formatting You have tried a very simple prompt above. A standard prompt has the following format: ``` <Question>? ``` or ``` <Instruction> ``` You can format this into a question answering (QA) format, which is standard in a lot of QA datasets, as follows: ``` Q: <Question>? A: ``` When prompting like the above, it\\'s also referred to as *zero-shot prompting*, i.e., you are directly prompting the model for a response without any examples or demonstrations about the task you want it to achieve. Some large language models have the ability to perform zero-shot prompting but it depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand and the tasks the model was trained to perform good on. A concrete prompt example is as follows: *Prompt* ``` Q: What is prompt engineering? ``` With some of the more recent models you can skip the \"Q:\" part as it is implied and understood by the model as a question answering task based on how the sequence is composed. In other words, the prompt could be simplified as follows: *Prompt* ``` What is prompt engineering? ``` Given the standard format above, one popular and effective technique to prompting is referred to as *few-shot prompting* where you provide exemplars (i.e., demonstrations). You can format few-shot prompts as follows: ``` <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? ``` The QA format version would look like this: ``` Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: ``` Keep in mind that it\\'s not required to use the QA format. The prompt format depends on the task at hand. For instance, you can perform a simple classification task and give exemplars that demonstrate the task as follows: *Prompt:* ``` This is awesome! // Positive This is bad! // Negative Wow that movie was rad! // Positive What a horrible show! // ``` *Output:* ``` Negative ``` Few-shot prompts enable in-context learning, which is the ability of language models to learn tasks given a few demonstrations. We discuss zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting more extensively in upcoming sections.']],\n",

This blog post summarize important aspects of designing effective prompts to maximize LLM performance. ### Key Considerations for Prompt Design **Specificity and Clarity:** Just like giving instructions to a human, prompts should clearly articulate the desired outcome. Ambiguity can lead to unexpected or irrelevant outputs. **Structured Inputs and Outputs:** Structuring inputs using formats like JSON or XML can significantly enhance an LLM\\'s ability to understand and process information. Similarly, specifying the desired output format (e.g., a list, paragraph, or code snippet) improves response relevance. **Delimiters for Enhanced Structure:** Utilizing special characters as delimiters within prompts can further clarify the structure and segregate different elements, improving the model\\'s understanding. **Task Decomposition for Complex Operations:** Instead of presenting LLMs with a monolithic prompt encompassing multiple tasks, breaking down complex processes into simpler subtasks significantly improves clarity and performance. This allows the model to focus on each subtask individually, ultimately leading to a more accurate overall outcome. ### Advanced Prompting Strategies **Few-Shot Prompting:** Providing the LLM with a few examples of desired input-output pairs guides it towards generating higher-quality responses by demonstrating the expected pattern. Learn more about few-shot prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot). **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encouraging the model to \"think step-by-step\" by explicitly prompting it to break down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps enhances its ability to solve problems that require logical deduction. Learn more about chain-of-thought prompting [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot). **ReAct (Reason + Act):** This method focuses on eliciting advanced reasoning, planning, and even tool use from the LLM. By structuring prompts to encourage these capabilities, developers can unlock more sophisticated and powerful applications. Learn more about ReAct [here](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react). ### Conclusion Effective prompt design is crucial for harnessing the full potential of LLMs. By adhering to best practices like specificity, structured formatting, task decomposition, and leveraging advanced techniques like few-shot, chain-of-thought, and ReAct prompting, developers can significantly improve the quality, accuracy, and complexity of outputs generated by these powerful LLMs. ### Want to Learn More? import { Callout } from \\'nextra/components\\' <Callout type= \"info\" emoji=\"🎉\"> We are excited to launch our brand new course website and releasing our first course on [Introduction to Prompt Engineering](https://dair-ai.thinkific.com/courses/introduction-prompt-engineering).

It\\'s common to encounter reliability issues in LLMs with even the slightest changes to prompts. LLM agents involve an entire prompt framework which makes it more prone to robustness issues. The potential solutions include crafting prompt elements through trial and error, automatically optimizing/tuning prompts, or automatically generating prompts using GPT. Another common issue with LLMs is hallucination which is also prevalent with LLM agents. These agents rely on natural language to interface with external components that could be introducing conflicting information leading to hallucination and factuality issues. - **Knowledge boundary**: similar to knowledge mismatch issues that could lead to hallucination or factuality issues, it\\'s challenging to control the knowledge scope of LLMs which can significantly impact the effectiveness of simulations. Concretely, an LLM\\'s internal knowledge could introduce biases or utilize user-unknown knowledge that could affect the agent\\'s behavior when operating in specific environments. - **Efficiency**: LLM agents involve a significant amount of requests that are handled by the LLM which could affect the efficiency of agent actions because it would depend heavily on the LLM inference speed. Cost is also a concern when deploying multiple agents. ## References - [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) - [MRKL Systems: A modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language models, external knowledge sources and discrete reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) - [A Survey on Large Language Model based Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432) - [The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864) - [Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01680) - [Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427) - [Introduction to LLM Agents](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/) - [LangChain Agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/tool_use/agents) - [Building Your First LLM Agent Application](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-your-first-llm-agent-application/) - [Building LLM applications for production](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html#control_flow_with_llm_agents) - [Awesome LLM agents](https://github.com/kaushikb11/awesome-llm-agents) - [Awesome LLM-Powered Agent](https://github.com/hyp1231/awesome-llm-powered-agent#awesome-llm-powered-agent) - [Functions, Tools and Agents with LangChain](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/functions-tools-agents-langchain/) e_ Prompt Engineering ° Guide Prompt Engineering Introduction > Techniques > Applications > Models v Flan ChatGPT Llama GPT-4 Mistral 7B Gemini LLM Collection Risks & Misuses > Papers Tools Notebooks Prompt Engineering Course Services About — Search...

Use this format for the examples: Q: <sentence> A: <sentiment> ``` *Output:* ``` Q: I just got the best news ever! A: Positive Q: We just got a raise at work! A: Positive Q: I\\'m so proud of what I accomplished today. A: Positive Q: I\\'m having the best day ever! A: Positive Q: I\\'m really looking forward to the weekend. A: Positive Q: I just got the best present ever! A: Positive Q: I\\'m so happy right now. A: Positive Q: I\\'m so blessed to have such an amazing family. A: Positive Q: The weather outside is so gloomy. A: Negative Q: I just got some terrible news. A: Negative ``` This is very useful. We use this example for a different test in another section of the guides. Here is another prompt example showing how to leverage the LLM for data labeling/augmentation task. *Prompt:* ``` produce 3 wine reviews and label taste, flavor, aroma related token; present the result as a json file, in addition add the coordinate of each term for NER task ``` *Output:* ``` [ { \"review\": \"This Chardonnay has a rich, creamy texture with notes of vanilla and buttery oak.

Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools. This guide covers the basics of standard prompts to provide a rough idea of how to use prompts to interact and instruct large language models (LLMs). All examples are tested with `text-davinci-003` (using OpenAI\\'s playground) unless otherwise specified. It uses the default configurations, e.g., `temperature=0.7` and `top-p=1`. Topic: - [Basic Prompts](#basic-prompts) - [A Word on LLM Settings](#a-word-on-llm-settings) - [Standard Prompts](#standard-prompts) - [Prompt Elements](#elements-of-a-prompt) - [General Tips for Designing Prompts](#general-tips-for-designing-prompts) --- ## Basic Prompts You can already achieve a lot with prompts, but the quality of results depends on how much information you provide it. A prompt can contain information like the `instruction` or `question` you are passing to the model and include other details such as `inputs` or `examples`. Here is a basic example of a simple prompt: *Prompt* ``` The sky is ``` *Output:* ``` blue The sky is blue on a clear day. On a cloudy day, the sky may be gray or white. ``` As you can see, the language model outputs a continuation of strings that make sense given the context `\"The sky is\"`. The output might be unexpected or far from the task we want to accomplish. This basic example also highlights the necessity to provide more context or instructions on what specifically we want to achieve. Let\\'s try to improve it a bit: *Prompt:* ``` Complete the sentence: The sky is ``` *Output:* ``` so beautiful today. ``` Is that better? Well, we told the model to complete the sentence so the result looks a lot better as it follows exactly what we told it to do (\"complete the sentence\"). This approach of designing optimal prompts to instruct the model to perform a task is what\\'s referred to as **prompt engineering**. The example above is a basic illustration of what\\'s possible with LLMs today. Today\\'s LLMs can perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation. --- ## A Word on LLM Settings When working with prompts, you will be interacting with the LLM via an API or directly. You can configure a few parameters to get different results for your prompts. **Temperature** - In short, the lower the temperature the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing the temperature could lead to more randomness encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. We are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens.

Today\\'s LLMs are able to perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation. ## Prompt Formatting You have tried a very simple prompt above. A standard prompt has the following format: ``` <Question>? ``` or ``` <Instruction> ``` You can format this into a question answering (QA) format, which is standard in a lot of QA datasets, as follows: ``` Q: <Question>? A: ``` When prompting like the above, it\\'s also referred to as *zero-shot prompting*, i.e., you are directly prompting the model for a response without any examples or demonstrations about the task you want it to achieve. Some large language models have the ability to perform zero-shot prompting but it depends on the complexity and knowledge of the task at hand and the tasks the model was trained to perform good on. A concrete prompt example is as follows: *Prompt* ``` Q: What is prompt engineering? ``` With some of the more recent models you can skip the \"Q:\" part as it is implied and understood by the model as a question answering task based on how the sequence is composed. In other words, the prompt could be simplified as follows: *Prompt* ``` What is prompt engineering? ``` Given the standard format above, one popular and effective technique to prompting is referred to as *few-shot prompting* where you provide exemplars (i.e., demonstrations). You can format few-shot prompts as follows: ``` <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? <Answer> <Question>? ``` The QA format version would look like this: ``` Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: <Answer> Q: <Question>? A: ``` Keep in mind that it\\'s not required to use the QA format. The prompt format depends on the task at hand. For instance, you can perform a simple classification task and give exemplars that demonstrate the task as follows: *Prompt:* ``` This is awesome! // Positive This is bad! // Negative Wow that movie was rad! // Positive What a horrible show! // ``` *Output:* ``` Negative ``` Few-shot prompts enable in-context learning, which is the ability of language models to learn tasks given a few demonstrations. We discuss zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting more extensively in upcoming sections.'"
